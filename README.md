**Zen: Foundry** is an adaptation of [Foundry](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/foundry) and [Ignition: Foundry](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/ignition-foundry) made for my friend's and my modpack, which focuses on compatibility to [Ceramics](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/ceramics). **Zen: Foundry** is also a Minecraft mod centered around melting and casting with metal.
